# Kubernetes Init Container Example: File Download and Setup for a Web Application

## Scenario Overview

This example demonstrates the use of an **init container** in Kubernetes to download configuration files from a remote server before starting the main application container. The downloaded files are necessary for the application to function correctly. The init container ensures the setup tasks (downloading configuration files) are completed before the main application container starts.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Init Container Task (File Download)

- The init container runs first and is responsible for downloading configuration files (such as JSON, YAML, or environment-specific files) from a remote server or cloud storage service (e.g., an S3 bucket).
- It checks if the files already exist in a mounted volume or shared storage. If not, it downloads them.

### 2. Main Application Container

- The main web application container (e.g., a Node.js app or Python Flask app) starts only after the init container completes its task and the configuration files are available locally.
- This ensures that the application starts with the correct configuration.

## Example Use Case

Imagine a web app that serves different content based on configuration files. These files are stored on an S3 bucket (or any other remote file server), and they need to be downloaded before the application starts.

### Kubernetes Pod Spec Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: web-app-pod
spec:
  initContainers:
    - name: download-config
      image: busybox:1.35
      command:
        [
          "sh",
          "-c",
          "wget -O /config/config.json https://my-s3-bucket/config.json",
        ]
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /config
          name: config-volume
  containers:
    - name: web-app
      image: my-web-app-image
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /app/config
          name: config-volume
  volumes:
    - name: config-volume
      emptyDir: {}
```
