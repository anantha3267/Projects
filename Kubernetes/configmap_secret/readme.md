# Kubernetes Secrets vs ConfigMaps

| **Feature**              | **Secrets**                         | **ConfigMaps**                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Kind of Info**         | Sensitive                           | Non-Sensitive                        |
| **Stored in etcd**       | Yes                                 | Yes                                  |
| **Base64-encoded**       | Yes                                 | No                                   |
| **Encrypted by Default** | No (must enable encryption at rest) | No (requires explicit configuration) |

## Explanation

### **1. Stored in etcd**

- Both Secrets and ConfigMaps are stored in Kubernetes' etcd database.

### **2. Base64-encoded**

- Secrets are Base64-encoded by default, providing only obfuscation, not encryption.
- ConfigMaps store data as plain text.

### **3. Encrypted by Default**

- Secrets are not encrypted unless **encryption at rest** is enabled in the Kubernetes cluster configuration.
- ConfigMaps are also not encrypted unless explicitly configured in the **EncryptionConfiguration** file.

## Best Practices

1. **Enable Encryption at Rest**:

   - Use Kubernetes' **encryption at rest** feature to secure Secrets and ConfigMaps stored in etcd.
   - Include both `secrets` and `configmaps` in your encryption configuration if ConfigMaps contain sensitive data.

2. **Use Secrets for Sensitive Data**:

   - Always store sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and tokens in Secrets rather than ConfigMaps.

3. **Limit Access**:

   - Apply strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) policies to restrict who can access Secrets and ConfigMaps.

4. **Monitor and Audit**:

   - Regularly audit your Kubernetes cluster for unauthorized access or insecure resource usage.

5. **Key Rotation**:
   - Periodically rotate encryption keys and re-encrypt existing data for enhanced security.

By following these practices, you can ensure sensitive data is better protected in your Kubernetes clusters.
